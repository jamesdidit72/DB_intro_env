- **DevOps Introdction**
- DevOps is a culture that bridges the gap between Development and Operation

- **Life before DevOps**
- Waterfall - V-Model
- Transition to Agile and SCRUM

- Create `vagrantfile` in the current location
```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

 config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
# creating a virtual machine ubuntu 


# assign private ip to our VM
 config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.10.100"   

 # Ensure to install hostsupdater plugin on our localhost before rerunning the vagrant
 config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.local"]

 # Sync folder from OS to VM
 config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/home/vagrant/app"
 
end

```
- create `provision.sh`
```
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install nginx -y
